1. Promises - the promises objects represents the
 eventual completion or failure of 
an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

A promise is three state 
1. Pending
2. Fullfilled
3.Rejected


// pros and cons of then , catch and async or await 

1.then and catch 
Pros:

Flexible Chaining: You can easily chain multiple asynchronous operations.
Error Handling per Step: You can attach multiple .catch() statements in between, handling errors at different stages.
Cons:

Nested and Hard to Read: As the number of chained promises grows, the code can get messy and harder to follow (commonly referred to as "callback hell").
Error Propagation: If an error occurs early in the chain, it will propagate down unless explicitly handled at each step.


Catch 
pros:

Cleaner & Readable: The code looks synchronous, making it easier to follow, especially when handling complex async logic.
Sequential Flow: You can read through the code in a top-down manner, which feels more intuitive.
Built-in Error Handling: try/catch blocks handle errors in a more traditional manner, and you can wrap multiple asynchronous calls in a single block.
Cons:
Sequential Execution (by Default): When using await, each promise waits for the previous one to resolve. This can result in performance issues when independent asynchronous tasks could be run in parallel.


question - what if api return 404 error where it will come either in respnse or error 
ans - it is come in response we identigy by using conditonal operatorss is is error or not 
fetch work only is to resolve the api call to the browser 

// the fetch request fullfill first as compare to other promises because 
in event loop fetch  request has special or more priority callback  queue(microtask queue) as compare to second normal queue 


// fetch internal machaenism  has work in two parts  
1. part one  first reserved the space in the  memory for operations, variables etc
a. onfulfilled[] - promise resolve
b. onRejection[] - on promise  rejections
they arre private and cannot be accessed 

now we have to send the network request than we need help of WebBrowser or Node Environment 
2. WebBrowser/Native Node to fullfill the requests
if request fullfilled than it give to onfullfilled memory or inc ase pf rejection it give to on rejection


After network request fullfill than it is send to global memory by the help of function avaiables
