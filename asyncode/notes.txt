1. javaScript is a synchronous language and single threaded langauage it is default js behaviour  
2. yes due to single threaded js is slow but js engine not be avaiable alone 
it always with with some run time environment like browsers , node.js 


3.Global Execution Context 
each operation waits for the last one to complete vefore Execution

4.BLocking code and non blocking code

Blocking Code - it block the flow of the programm  e.g - Reead File Synchronous
Non Blocking  it not block the further execution of the programm  e.g - read file asynchronous (baaki ka kaam krie or aap apna kaam kare )

Both are best according to sue case 
for registering a user blocking code is useful 

// note - fetch ke liye jo queue hoti ahi vo thodi high priority hoti hai 
par vo ye kehti hai jab kaam ho bata dena par kaam hone ke baad high priority hoti hai
